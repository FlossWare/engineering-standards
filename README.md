# FlossWare Engineering Standards

This repository defines shared engineering standards, architecture decisions, and development conventions for the FlossWare ecosystem.

## Core Principles

- Configuration is the source of truth.
- Defaults are minimal; capabilities are explicitly enabled.
- Components are modular and composable.
- Contracts define stable semantics; implementations realize those contracts without becoming the architectural authority.
- Repository names SHALL communicate contract, domain, and implementation-language roles where a contract family is split across repositories.
- Avoid unnecessary coupling.
- Favor automation, repeatability, and infrastructure-as-code.
- Released artifacts are derived, reproducible delivery outputs, not sources of truth.

See the core ADRs below for normative statements. AI-domain architecture decisions are maintained in FlossWare/loom-ai.

## Architecture Decisions

Architecture decisions are documented as ADRs under [`adr/`](adr/).

| [ADR-0007](adr/ADR-0007-unified-client-service-contract.md) | Unified Client-Service Contract |
| [ADR-0008](adr/ADR-0008-free-first-modular-platform.md) | Historical Free-First Platform Policy (Superseded) |
| [ADR-0009](adr/ADR-0009-core-architecture-principles.md) | Core Architecture Principles |
| [ADR-0010](adr/ADR-0010-rest-service-boundaries.md) | REST Service Boundaries and Integration |
| [ADR-0011](adr/ADR-0011-stored-procedure-database-access.md) | Stored Procedure Database Access Policy |
| [ADR-0016](adr/ADR-0016-configuration-as-source-of-truth.md) | Configuration as Source of Truth |
| [ADR-0022](adr/ADR-0022-reproducible-build-artifacts-and-distribution.md) | Reproducible Build Artifacts and Distribution |
| [ADR-0023](adr/ADR-0023-canonical-flossware-ai-state-root.md) | Canonical FlossWare AI Persistent State Root |
| [ADR-0024](adr/ADR-0024-contract-centric-repository-layering-and-naming.md) | Contract-Centric Repository Layering and Naming |
| [ADR-0025](adr/ADR-0025-ai-architecture-ownership.md) | AI Architecture Ownership |

New ADRs SHOULD use [`adr/TEMPLATE.md`](adr/TEMPLATE.md).

### AI-domain ADRs

AI architecture decisions are owned by FlossWare/loom-ai. This repository retains generic engineering principles and FlossWare-wide infrastructure decisions.

## Reference architecture

- [Reference architecture diagram](docs/architecture/reference-architecture.md) (Mermaid)
- [tftp-os client contract validation](docs/architecture/reference-implementations/tftp-os-ui-contract.md)

## ADR Process

All ADRs should include:

- Status
- Date
- Context
- Scope and Non-goals (recommended; required for new ADRs)
- Decision
- Consequences (positive and negative)
- Alternatives considered
- Related ADRs

RFC 2119 keywords are used consistently:

- SHALL / SHALL NOT: mandatory requirements (MUST is treated as equivalent to SHALL)
- SHOULD / SHOULD NOT: strong recommendation
- MAY: optional behavior
