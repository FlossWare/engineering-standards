# ADR-0025: AI Architecture Ownership

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-09-18

## Context

FlossWare previously stored AI-specific architecture decisions in the generic engineering-standards repository. As the AI architecture has become a coherent domain with its own contracts, execution model, providers, evaluation, routing, consensus, and learning concerns, those decisions need a domain-owned architectural home.

## Decision

Generic engineering principles and FlossWare-wide infrastructure decisions SHALL remain in this repository.

AI-domain contracts and AI-specific architecture decisions SHALL be maintained by FlossWare/loom-ai.

The Loom AI ADR set includes provider abstraction, execution topology, model inventory and selection, token budgets, MCP and agent capability semantics, consensus, and durable/shared intelligence.

Engineering standards MAY define generic principles that apply to AI systems, but SHALL NOT duplicate or redefine Loom AI domain semantics.

The loom-ai repository is authoritative for AI-domain meaning; language-specific implementations remain in the corresponding implementation repositories.

## Consequences

- Generic engineering standards remain reusable outside Loom.
- AI architecture evolves with the AI-domain contract rather than accumulating in a generic repository.
- Cross-repository references are explicit and ownership is unambiguous.
- Historical AI ADRs retain their substance in the Loom repository while engineering-standards no longer acts as a competing authority.

## Alternatives Considered

### Keep AI ADRs in engineering-standards
Rejected because the generic repository would continue accumulating domain-specific architecture.

### Duplicate AI ADRs in both repositories
Rejected because duplicated normative decisions inevitably diverge.

### Move AI ADRs to loom-ai
Chosen because loom-ai is the AI-domain contract and semantics repository.
